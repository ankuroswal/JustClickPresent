## Summary 

Just Click Present is a web service that builds dynamic PowerPoints with a single search term for Hackpoly2015. The powerpoints are created with flickr and wikipedia's API's in order to get high quality images and content. We also use PHPPowerPoint's open source library to create power points using PHP. Our target user is a high school or college student that has to present on a topic but doesn't have the time or knowledge to create a deck. User interaction is made easy with our simple yet appealing interface.
