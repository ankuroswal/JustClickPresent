# JustClickPresent


Just Click Present is a web service that builds dynamic PowerPoints with a single search term for Hackpoly2015. The powerpoints are created with flickr and wikipedia's API's in order to get high quality images and content. We also use PHPPowerPoint's open source library to create power points via PHP. Our target user is a high school or college student that has to present on a topic but doesn't have the time or knowledge to create a deck. We have a modern and visually appealing user interface that makes user interaction easy. 
We are most proud of our ability to create the dynamic PowerPoints.
